# Application Submission to the Showcase

If you want to submit your application to be displayed on the PhoneGap App
Showcase, then follow this submission template to help expedite the review of
your app.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of things that the PhoneGap review team
looks for in showcase applications:

- [ ] Is the app cross-platform?
- [ ] Does it have a pretty good visual design?
- [ ] Is your app available on at least two of the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or the Windows Store?
- [ ] Does it have at least a 4/5 star rating on the stores?
- [ ] Is it an app with a relatively unique concept?
- [ ] Is the app useful or impactful?
- [ ] Does it contain some level of complexity, showing off what is possible with PhoneGap?
